# JavaScript-Projects
This repository contains all of my JavaScript assignments, exercises, and challenges for this course. I will be regularly pushing my code here as I progress through the lessons. Each folder or file represents different topics and skills I am learning, including variables, functions, loops, events, DOM manipulation, and more.

This repository will also be used by my instructor to review my work throughout the course. I will continue updating it as I complete new tasks and build my coding portfolio.
